## About
A Simple & Beautiful **Flutter App** with minimal animations, which implements **Human Activity Recognition** (a Deep Learning TensorFlow Model) using Smartphone's Sensors.
### Human Activity Recognition
Human activity recognition, or HAR, is a challenging time series classification task. It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor (here, smartphone sensors) data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model.
- **Smartphone Sensors used:**
  1. Accelerometer
  2. Gyroscope

- **Activities Recognised:**
  1. Walking
  2. Walking Upstairs
  3. Walking Downstairs
  4. Sitting 
  5. Standing
  6. Laying
